### Explanation of `mkdir`

The `mkdir` (make directory) command creates one or more new directories in the filesystem. It's a fundamental tool for organizing files by creating new folders, commonly used in both basic and advanced Linux tasks.

**Key Options and Usage**:

- **Basic usage**: `mkdir dirname` creates a single directory named `dirname` in the current directory (e.g., `mkdir projects`).

- **Multiple directories**: `mkdir dir1 dir2 dir3` creates multiple directories at once (e.g., `mkdir docs logs backups`).

- **`-p`**: Create parent directories as needed, without errors if they already exist (e.g., `mkdir -p parent/child/grandchild` creates the full path).

- **`-m MODE`**: Set permissions for the new directory (e.g., `mkdir -m 750 secure_dir` creates `secure_dir` with `rwxr-x---` permissions).

- **`-v`**: Verbose mode, print a message for each created directory (e.g., `mkdir -v newdir` outputs `mkdir: created directory 'newdir'`).

- **Absolute/relative paths**: Create directories at specific locations (e.g., `mkdir /tmp/testdir` or `mkdir ./subdir`).

- **No arguments**: `mkdir` without arguments fails with an error (e.g., `mkdir: missing operand`).

**Common Notes**:

- Requires write (`w`) and execute (`x`) permissions in the parent directory to create a new directory.

- Fails if the directory already exists (unless using `-p`) or if permissions are insufficient.

- Case-sensitive (e.g., `Docs` ≠ `docs`).

- Output can be redirected or piped, though `mkdir` typically produces minimal output (except with `-v`).

### 10 Problem Scenarios/Requirements for `mkdir` (Basic to Advanced)

*Note*: Hints indicate if other commands are needed.

1\. **Basic: Create a Single Directory**  

   Requirement: In your home directory, use `mkdir` to create a directory named `work`. Verify it exists using another command.  

   *Hint*: Requires `ls` with `mkdir`.

2\. **Basic: Create Multiple Directories**  

   Requirement: In your home directory, use `mkdir` to create three directories named `data`, `logs`, and `scripts` in a single command. List them to confirm creation.  

   *Hint*: Requires `ls` with `mkdir`.

3\. **Basic: Create Directory in Specific Location**  

   Requirement: Use `mkdir` to create a directory named `temp` in `/tmp`. Navigate to `/tmp` and confirm `temp` exists.  

   *Hint*: Requires `cd` and `ls` with `mkdir`.

4\. **Intermediate: Create Nested Directories with Parent Option**  

   Requirement: Use `mkdir` to create a nested structure `~/projects/backend/api/v1` in one command, ensuring parent directories are created. Verify the full path exists.  

   *Hint*: Requires `ls` or `cd` with `mkdir`.

5\. **Intermediate: Set Specific Permissions**  

   Requirement: Use `mkdir` to create a directory `restricted` in your home directory with permissions `rwxr-x---` (750). Confirm the permissions using another command.  

   *Hint*: Requires `ls -l` with `mkdir`.

6\. **Intermediate: Verbose Creation**  

   Requirement: In `/tmp`, use `mkdir` to create two directories `backup1` and `backup2` with verbose output. Capture the output in a file `mkdir_output.txt` and display it.  

   *Hint*: Requires `cat` with `mkdir`.

7\. **Intermediate: Handle Existing Directory**  

   Requirement: Create a directory `test` in your home directory using `mkdir`. Attempt to create it again without the parent option and note the error. Then, use `mkdir` with the parent option to attempt creation without an error.  

   *Hint*: Requires `cat` or `echo` to capture error with `mkdir`.

8\. **Advanced: Create Multiple Nested Structures**  

   Requirement: In your home directory, use `mkdir` to create two nested structures in one command: `archive/2023/jan` and `archive/2024/jan`. Verify both `jan` directories exist using a single command.  

   *Hint*: Requires `ls` or `find` with `mkdir`.

9\. **Advanced: Create Directory with Restricted Parent Permissions**  

   Requirement: Create a directory `/tmp/locked` with permissions `rwx------` (700) using `mkdir`. Then, attempt to create `/tmp/locked/inner` as a non-root user and note the permission error. Use `sudo` to create `/tmp/locked/inner` and confirm its existence.  

   *Hint*: Requires `chmod`, `ls`, and `sudo` with `mkdir`.

10\. **Advanced: Organize Files into Directories**  

    Requirement: In `/tmp`, create two files `report.txt` and `data.csv` (e.g., using `touch`). Use `mkdir` to create directories `reports` and `datasets`. Move `report.txt` to `reports` and `data.csv` to `datasets` using another command, then use `ls` to confirm each file is in its respective directory.  

    *Hint*: Requires `touch`, `mv`, and `ls` with `mkdir`.
